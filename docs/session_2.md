# Session 2: Counter on 7 segments

## Our goal

![7segments counter](figures/7seg_counter.gif)

## Create a new CodeVisionAVR project

We should make a new CodeVisionAVR project
with `ATmega32` selected as the cip.
Then we remove all the comments and all the
initialization, because we want to make
an initialization of our own.

## Define variables in first block

CodVisionAVR requires us to declare all the variables
that we want in the first block.
So we are not allowed to define a variable
in a routine.

## 7seg config
